<!--
This repository is for the elementary OS build system and **not a catch-all for the OS itself**. Please do not file issues for the operating system itself or apps here, as they will be closed or need to be manually transferred.

If you are on elementary OS and trying to report an issue with something in the OS itself:

1. Open System Settigns → About → Report a Problem
2. Choose the appropriate category and component
3. Follow the prompts to report a problem

If you are not on elementary OS, please:

1. Visit https://github.com/elementary
2. Use your best effort to find the correct repository
3. Check for similar or duplicate issues to what you're trying to report
4. If none are found, file a new issue against that repository

Please remember, the more time that we have to spend triaging issues is less time we have to address the ones that are already open. :)
